Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,he broke the laws of the elders
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,so they plucked out his eye
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,took his land and fortune
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,left him to die
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,bound on the shoreline
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,left for the tide
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,sees his life blood leaving
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,circling lower the vultures fly
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,these bones may be broken
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,but the spirit cant die
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and the gods see his anguish
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and give him a sign
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,from the floor of the ocean
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,the ship of the lost souls rise
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and they take him where no one sleeps
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,while the undead cry
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,where no one sleeps while the undead cry
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and in the world above
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,the elders sing
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,on his land they live
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,let deaths bell ring
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,he was met at the gate of hades
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,by the guardian of the lost souls
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,the keeper of the unavenged
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and he did say to him
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,let you not pass abandon return to the world from once you came
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and seek payment not only for thy known anguish
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,but vindicate the souls of the unavenged
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and they placed in his hands a sword made for him called vengeance
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,forged in brimstone and tempered by the woeful tears of the unavenged
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and to carry him up on his journey back to the upper world
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,they brought forth their demon horse called black death
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,a grim steed so fiercely might and black in colour
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,that he could stand as one with the darkness
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,save from his burning eyes of crimson fire
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and on that night they rode up from hell
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,the pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,burning death destruction raping the daughters and wives
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,in blood i take my payment in full with their lives

Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and they placed in his hands a sword made for him called vengeance
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,forged in brimstone and tempered by the woeful tears of the unavenged
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and to carry him up on his journey back to the upper world
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,they brought forth their demon horse called black death
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,a grim steed so fiercely might and black in colour
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,that he could stand as one with the darkness
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,save from his burning eyes of crimson fire
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and on that night they rode up from hell

The Warriors Prayer,The Warriors Prayer,like brown leaves blown by the wind
The Warriors Prayer,The Warriors Prayer,and i saw the four ride together to the top of the hill
The Warriors Prayer,The Warriors Prayer,while below them the soldiers of death assembled
The Warriors Prayer,The Warriors Prayer,all those who would now swear allegiance to them
The Warriors Prayer,The Warriors Prayer,and the four spoke the words of the warriors prayer

Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,so they plucked out his eye
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,took his land and fortune
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,left him to die
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,bound on the shoreline
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,left for the tide
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,sees his life blood leaving
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,circling lower the vultures fly
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,these bones may be broken
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,but the spirit cant die
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and the gods see his anguish
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and give him a sign
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,from the floor of the ocean
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,the ship of the lost souls rise
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and they take him where no one sleeps
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,while the undead cry
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,where no one sleeps while the undead cry
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and in the world above
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,the elders sing
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,on his land they live

Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,he was met at the gate of hades
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,by the guardian of the lost souls
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,the keeper of the unavenged
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and he did say to him
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,let you not pass abandon return to the world from once you came
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and seek payment not only for thy known anguish
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,but vindicate the souls of the unavenged
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and they placed in his hands a sword made for him called vengeance
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,forged in brimstone and tempered by the woeful tears of the unavenged
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and to carry him up on his journey back to the upper world
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,they brought forth their demon horse called black death
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,a grim steed so fiercely might and black in colour
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,that he could stand as one with the darkness
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,save from his burning eyes of crimson fire
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,and on that night they rode up from hell
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,the pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,burning death destruction raping the daughters and wives
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,in blood i take my payment in full with their lives
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,no one can escape me on black death i ride
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,when kissed by the sword of vengeance
Dark Avenger,Dark Avenger,your head lays there by your side
