I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre pushing me from black to white
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre pushing til theres nothing more to hear
I Want Out,I Want Out,but dont push me to the maximum
I Want Out,I Want Out,shut your mouth and take it home

I Want Out,I Want Out,sometimes we need to be alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,no no no leave me alone

I Want Out,I Want Out,from our lives beginning on
I Want Out,I Want Out,we are pushed in little forms
I Want Out,I Want Out,no one asks us how we like to be
I Want Out,I Want Out,in school they teach you what to think
I Want Out,I Want Out,but everyone says different things
I Want Out,I Want Out,but theyre all convinced that
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre the ones to see
I Want Out,I Want Out,so they keep talking and they never stop
I Want Out,I Want Out,and at a certain point you give it up
I Want Out,I Want Out,so the only thing thats left to think is this
I Want Out,I Want Out,chorus
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to live my life alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out leave me be
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to do things on my own
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to live my life and to be free
I Want Out,I Want Out,people tell me a and b	
I Want Out,I Want Out,they tell me how i have to see
I Want Out,I Want Out,things that i have seen already clear
I Want Out,I Want Out,so they push me then from side to side
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre pushing me from black to white
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre pushing til theres nothing more to hear
I Want Out,I Want Out,but dont push me to the maximum
I Want Out,I Want Out,shut your mouth and take it home
I Want Out,I Want Out,cause i decide the way things gonna be
I Want Out,I Want Out,chorus
I Want Out,I Want Out,theres a million ways to see the things in life
I Want Out,I Want Out,a million ways to be the fool
I Want Out,I Want Out,in the end of it none of us is right
I Want Out,I Want Out,sometimes we need to be alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,no no no leave me alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,chorus

I Want Out,I Want Out,from our lives beginning on
I Want Out,I Want Out,we are pushed in little forms
I Want Out,I Want Out,no one asks us how we like to be
I Want Out,I Want Out,in school they teach you what to think
I Want Out,I Want Out,but everyone says different things
I Want Out,I Want Out,but theyre all convinced that
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre the ones to see
I Want Out,I Want Out,so they keep talking and they never stop
I Want Out,I Want Out,and at a certain point you give it up
I Want Out,I Want Out,so the only thing thats left to think is this
I Want Out,I Want Out,chorus
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to live my life alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out leave me be
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to do things on my own
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to live my life and to be free
I Want Out,I Want Out,people tell me a and b	
I Want Out,I Want Out,they tell me how i have to see
I Want Out,I Want Out,things that i have seen already clear
I Want Out,I Want Out,so they push me then from side to side
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre pushing me from black to white
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre pushing til theres nothing more to hear
I Want Out,I Want Out,but dont push me to the maximum
I Want Out,I Want Out,shut your mouth and take it home
I Want Out,I Want Out,cause i decide the way things gonna be
I Want Out,I Want Out,chorus
I Want Out,I Want Out,theres a million ways to see the things in life
I Want Out,I Want Out,a million ways to be the fool
I Want Out,I Want Out,in the end of it none of us is right
I Want Out,I Want Out,sometimes we need to be alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,no no no leave me alone

I Want Out,I Want Out,from our lives beginning on
I Want Out,I Want Out,we are pushed in little forms
I Want Out,I Want Out,no one asks us how we like to be
I Want Out,I Want Out,in school they teach you what to think
I Want Out,I Want Out,but everyone says different things
I Want Out,I Want Out,but theyre all convinced that
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre the ones to see
I Want Out,I Want Out,so they keep talking and they never stop
I Want Out,I Want Out,and at a certain point you give it up
I Want Out,I Want Out,so the only thing thats left to think is this
I Want Out,I Want Out,chorus
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to live my life alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out leave me be
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to do things on my own
I Want Out,I Want Out,i want out to live my life and to be free
I Want Out,I Want Out,people tell me a and b	
I Want Out,I Want Out,they tell me how i have to see
I Want Out,I Want Out,things that i have seen already clear
I Want Out,I Want Out,so they push me then from side to side
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre pushing me from black to white
I Want Out,I Want Out,theyre pushing til theres nothing more to hear
I Want Out,I Want Out,but dont push me to the maximum
I Want Out,I Want Out,shut your mouth and take it home
I Want Out,I Want Out,cause i decide the way things gonna be
I Want Out,I Want Out,chorus
I Want Out,I Want Out,theres a million ways to see the things in life
I Want Out,I Want Out,a million ways to be the fool
I Want Out,I Want Out,in the end of it none of us is right
I Want Out,I Want Out,sometimes we need to be alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,no no no leave me alone
I Want Out,I Want Out,chorus
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,as long as i remember
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,weve marched across this land
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,oh oh 
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,reached for a new horizon
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,pulled by the killing hand
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,oh oh 
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,all fed up with lies
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,the time has come
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,to break these chains and fly
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,here we stand bound forevermore
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,were out of this world until the end
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,here we are mighty glorious
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,at the end of the rainbow
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,with gold in our hands
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,we know the treasure lies
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,beyond the pouring rain
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,oh oh 
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,our quest will last forever
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,for you its all the same
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,oh oh 
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,no one can deny
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,our futures set
At the End of the Rainbow,At the End of the Rainbow,to reach above the sky
